Radio Automation Software in Delphi 5

## Disclaimer
This app was written at Radio Planet (Paraná ER Argentina) in the winter of 1997 and last compiled in 1999.

It was used for play scheduled audio content (including music, announces and "hour & time" service) in the new by then mp3 format over unstable Win95/486 machines in a weekly automated basis due to a limited storage hard discs drives of the time.

The vlcs and third part libraries are mainly not included, the purpose of this repository is simple: backup old code and share it for enjoyment of potential employers and Delphi´s programmers not believing in abandonwares.
